### What did I do?

I see all students learned about git through a hands-on session with Prof. Joanna.
They got knowledge on interesting commands like git merge, git squash and many more.

I read through few blogs of students about extension activity.
It seemed like an interesting activity for students to create their own extensions.

They seemed to have enjoyed the presentations and the coding, project work.
From what I read, the Tomato Clock, Infinite scroller were some of the favourite projects.
All the extensions were really thoughtful and made as a complete project.

I have been conducting office hours for few weeks. The students are quite well motivated towards the coursework and haven't found any doubts/roadblocks yet.

All in all, it was a good week!
